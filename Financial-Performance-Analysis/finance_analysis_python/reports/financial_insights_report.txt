📊 Summary

This project analyzes the financial performance of an accounting services firm using Power BI and Python. After cleaning and preparing the data, key metrics such as revenue, expenditure, net income, profit margin, and debt-to-equity ratio were calculated to evaluate business health. Monthly trend analysis showed that revenue and profitability were strongest during mid-year, while the last quarter experienced a seasonal slowdown. Despite fluctuations in sales, expenses were well controlled, resulting in stable profit margins and manageable financial risk. Overall, the company demonstrates consistent profitability and sound financial management.

Based on the analysis, the business should focus on improving sales strategies before low-performing months to reduce seasonal dips in revenue. Monitoring and optimizing expenditures during peak periods can further increase profitability. Maintaining stable profit margins through cost control and carefully managing debt levels will help reduce financial risk. Regular monthly tracking using dashboards and automated reports is recommended to support timely and data-driven decision-making.
